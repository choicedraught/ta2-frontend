# Tigers Availability 2 - Front End

This is the second major iteration of the Tigers Availability App with a distinct front endand backend.  This code base is for the front end and is based on create-react-app.  I have used this opporunity to learn about react and JS frameworks and now I look at my old code and am quite ashamed! :) 

This first commit represents the MVP in terms of functionality, prior to integrating AWS Cognito for auth and the backend data store.
